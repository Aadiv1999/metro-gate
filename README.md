# Metro Gate
A simple program replicating the RFID Token Validation systems used in Metro Stations using Arduino Uno  
RF Tokens are read using the MFRC522 operating at 13.56Mhz. Two 5V servos are used to actuate/simulate the movement of the gates  
Servo 1 = digital pin 6  
Servo 2 = digital pin 7
Green LED = digital pin 13
